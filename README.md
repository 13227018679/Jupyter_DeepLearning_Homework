- **./DL_week_\*** is the homework of every week (some dataset is not included in the folders because of the file size limit);
- **./Identify Cactus** is the the implementation of [Cactus Identification on Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/aerial-cactus-identification) for our team final project;
- **./Cycle-GAN** is the [Cycle-GAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.10593.pdf) implementation for my personal final project (this is a fine-tuning version).
